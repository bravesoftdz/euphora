Euphora
=======

Euphora - a Web-oriented automation language written in Delphi &amp; Alcinoe.

I made this program to appease my job as a teaching assistant -- mainly grading ~30 assignments with feedback in the form of uploaded documents and customized e-mail notifications sent in bulk.  I use it to mock HTTP requests and automate small page scraping tasks at my current job.

Originally I wrote some scripts in Perl to solve the issue, however because of the portability issues (i.e. future TAs) and customization by non-programmers, I wanted to avoid ditching this on someone with little experience in the event of customization.

I wrote this entirely in Borland/Embarcadero Delphi with the [Alcinoe](http://sourceforge.net/projects/alcinoe/) library.  I'll add links, some examples, and more documentation later (maybe).

Euphora is mainly procedural and does not provide any conditional logic by choice.  This is just on GitHub for anyone who is curious or wants to use my code.  Enjoy! :-)
