euphora
=======

Euphora - a Web-oriented automation language written in Delphi &amp; ICS.

I made this program to appease my job as a teaching assistant -- mainly grading ~30 assignments with feedback in the form of uploaded documents and customized e-mail notifications sent in bulk.

Originally I wrote some scripts in Perl to solve the issue, however because of the portability issues (i.e. future TAs) and customization by non-programmers, I wanted to avoid ditching this on someone with little experience in the event of customization.

Euphora is mainly procedural and does not provide any conditional logic by choice.  This is just on GitHub for anyone who is curious or wants to use my code.  I don't expect to have many commits as I rarely update the interpreter (it does what I want already).  Enjoy! :-)
